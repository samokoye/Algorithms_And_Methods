    "- The third most frequent char (v3) function returned the last max occurring char\n",

    " Unlike the first two functions, it does not loop through the string twice\n",
    " to check for any other char with the same max occurance count.\n",
    " Hence it overwrites the max_char variable whenever\n",
    " it finds a char with the same max occurrance count later in the string.\n",
